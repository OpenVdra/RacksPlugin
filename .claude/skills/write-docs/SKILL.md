# Writing Racks docs and changelog

You are writing for **server owners and players**, not developers. They install the plugin, edit config files, and put a pickaxe on a rack in game. They do not care about classes, methods, refactors, or how something works internally.

## Voice and rules (always)

- Short and clear. One idea per sentence. Cut every word that adds nothing.
- Say what changed for the user and why it matters to them. Never describe the code or the internal mechanism.
- No duplicate information. If a point is already made, do not restate it in another section.
- Plain words over jargon. If a technical term is unavoidable, keep it to the exact config key, command, or permission node the user types.
- Never mention HikariCP, the write-behind writer thread, the region scheduler, display entities, interaction hitboxes, codecs, shading, the schema migrator, or SQL. A rack is a rack, not "a row and a set of entities". Reliability work the reader cannot see is not a feature.
- Name a setting by its own key plus the file: "the `adopt-datapack-racks` setting in `config.yml`". Never write a dotted path like `settings.wall-support-check-interval` or `protection.worldguard`, the reader never sees one in the file.
- When permission nodes overlap, the result **applies**. It does not "win" (Vietnamese: "được áp dụng", not "thắng").
- Write "rack", not "rack block" or "rack entity" (Vietnamese: "giá treo"), except when the sentence is really about the block a floor rack stands on. "Floor rack" and "wall rack" when the distinction matters.
- Never use the em-dash character. Use a comma, a full stop, or rewrite the sentence.
- Never use emoji anywhere.
- Match the existing tone of the file you are editing.
- Write like a person telling another person what the plugin does, not like ad copy. No personification ("tools deserve better"), no rhetorical problem-then-fix openers, no "puts them on display" style flourishes. State the fact plainly: "Adds wooden display racks for tools and weapons."
- Mention the data pack relationship once per page, briefly. Don't build a sentence out of "same as the data pack" repeated for each detail (recipe, poses, rules, offsets...). One line establishing it's a port is enough; let the rest of the page just describe what the plugin does.

## Changelog

- File: `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root. Both changelog pages on the docs site include this file, so you only edit this one file.
- Newest version goes at the top, right under the intro line.
- Format:

  ```
  ## <version> - <YYYY-MM-DD>

  ### Added
  - ...

  ### Changed
  - ...

  ### Fixed
  - ...

  ### Notes
  - ...
  ```

- No `v` prefix on the version. Use only the sections you need (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Notes`). Skip empty ones.
- Get the version from `build.gradle.kts` (`version = "..."`).
- Build the change list from `git log <previous-tag-or-commit>..HEAD --format="%h %s%n%b"`, then drop every commit that only touches `docs/`, `.claude/`, any `CLAUDE.md`, or internals with no visible effect. Never copy a commit subject verbatim.
- Each line is one user-facing outcome. Good: "Sneak and right-click a rack now changes the pose." Bad: "Refactored RackRepository into a write-behind cache."
- Never address the reader as `you`, `your`, or `yours`. State the behavior or required action directly.
- Summarize the affected behavior once. Do not list multiple example scenarios when one general statement is accurate.
- Keep each bullet to one or two short sentences, roughly 25 words when possible. Use sub-bullets only when essential details cannot be stated clearly in the main bullet.
- Do not explain both the old and new behavior unless the contrast is required to understand the change.
- Backticks for every command, permission node, config key, and plugin name.
- A renamed or removed command, permission, or config key is breaking. Put it first in `Changed`, prefix it with **Breaking:**, give old to new, and name the one action the admin must take. This does not apply before the first release, where a key that never shipped is simply left out.
- Reserve `Notes` for required upgrade actions, compatibility details, or a brief "no action required" statement. Do not repeat other sections or document every edge case.

## Config comments (`src/main/resources/config.yml`)

The comment above a setting is the only documentation most admins ever read. It has to answer "what does this do and what happens if I change it" in one or two lines, in the same plain voice as the docs site.

- **Say what the setting does to the server, not how the plugin implements it.** An admin does not know what a tick, a chunk, a queue or an entity is. Translate the consequence into something they can see: racks falling later, more work for the server, players unable to craft.
- Keep it to one or two lines under 100 characters each. If a setting genuinely needs more, link the docs site instead of writing a paragraph.
- Name the trade-off when there is one. `# Higher means less work for the server and a longer wait before a rack falls.` is worth more than a sentence explaining the feature twice.
- **List the accepted values in full** when there is a fixed set. For free-form values, give the format and an example. For a value in ticks, state the conversion once: `# 20 ticks is one second.`
- Say what the setting cannot do when that is a likely wrong assumption, for example that only languages with a folder under `language/` can be shown.
- Settings that need a full restart are marked `# NEED RESTART:` on the line above, covering either one setting or a named group of them. Everything else applies on `/racks reload`, which the file header already states, so never repeat it per setting.
- No em-dash, no emoji, no second person outside the header lines that already use it.
- A new key needs its default in three places that must agree: the value in `config.yml`, the fallback in `PluginConfig`, and the `value` prop of its `<ConfigProperty>` in both `docs/docs/configuration.md` and `docs/vi/docs/configuration.md`.
- Removing a key means removing its `<ConfigGroup>` or `<ConfigProperty>` from both configuration pages **and** from the full-file example lower down the same pages, then adding a **Breaking:** changelog entry under `Changed`.

## Documentation site (VitePress, in `docs/`)

- Bilingual. English lives in `docs/docs/`, Vietnamese in `docs/vi/docs/`. When you add or change a page, update both languages so they stay in sync.
- A new page must be added to the `pages` array and to both sidebars in `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`, or it renders without a sidebar.
- Every page starts with frontmatter, at minimum a title:

  ```
  ---
  title: Page Title
  ---
  ```

- Use normal Markdown: headings, short paragraphs, numbered lists for steps. Keep pages scannable.
- Do not put `---` horizontal rules between sections. Heading levels carry the structure.
- VitePress custom containers (`::: tip`, `::: warning`) are fine for a single important callout. Do not overuse them.

### Components

- Cards go inside `<CardGrid>`. `<DocCard icon="Package" title="..." link="/docs/..." desc="one sentence" />` links to another page, `<FeatureCard icon="Axe" title="...">` holds slot content. Omit the `icon` prop entirely when you do not want one, never pass an empty string or an emoji.
- Commands use `<CommandRow commands="/racks give" :aliases="['/rack give']" permission="racks.command.give">` with one or two sentences inside. Do not wrap it in a div.
- Configuration pages use `<ConfigProperty>` inside `<ConfigGroup>`. A top-level key that is not in a group takes a bare `<ConfigProperty>`.
- Screenshot rows use `<Gallery :items="[{ src: '/media/x.png', alt: '...' }]" :columns="2" />`.
- Permissions pages are plain Markdown, not tables. Use a bold node then its description on the next line, or a single line for the admin command list:

  ```md
  **`racks.use`**
  One sentence describing what this unlocks.

  **`racks.command.give`** - `/racks give`: one-line description.
  ```

### Lucide icons

- The site uses Lucide icons through a registered component. Inline syntax in Markdown is `<LucideIcon name="Download" :size="20" />`; card icons take the same names through the `icon` prop.
- Only icon names registered in `docs/.vitepress/components/icon/LucideIcon.vue` work. Before using an icon, check that its name is in that file's `ICONS` map.
- To use a new icon: add its import and an entry to the `ICONS` map in `LucideIcon.vue`, then reference it by that name. Use PascalCase Lucide names (for example `ShieldCheck`, `ArrowRightLeft`).
- Prefer a Lucide icon over an emoji or an image whenever you want a small inline symbol.

## Modrinth description (`docs/public/MODRINTH.md`)

The store page. It sells the plugin to someone who has never heard of it, in one screen.

- Lead with a plain one-line tagline plus a one-line description, the way the README does: "**Show off your tools.** Adds wooden display racks for tools and weapons. No resource pack required." Not a rhetorical problem statement.
- A `## Highlights` list of short bullets, each opening with a bolded phrase. Link the bullet's phrase to the matching docs page when there is one.
- Include the screenshot section, the command tables, and a `## Get started` block naming the Minecraft version, server software, and Java version.
- Raw HTML is allowed here because Modrinth renders it, unlike the rest of the docs. Badges and centered images are fine.
- Keep it in sync with the feature set. A highlight that no longer exists is worse than no highlight.

## Before finishing

- Re-read your text once and delete any sentence that repeats another.
- Shorten any changelog entry that is noticeably more verbose than the surrounding releases without adding necessary information.
- Search changelog changes for second-person wording such as `you`, `your`, and `yours`, and rewrite it.
- Search your output for the em-dash character and any emoji, and remove them.
- If you touched a docs page, confirm the matching page in the other language was updated too.
- If you touched `config.yml`, re-read each comment you wrote and cut any word that describes the plugin's internals rather than what the admin will notice.
